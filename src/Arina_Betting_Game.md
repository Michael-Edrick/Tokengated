## Betting Mechanism

### Key Concepts for Fair Betting

1. **Betting Pools**:

   - Create a separate betting pool for each challenge, aggregating all bets placed by supporters and players.

2. **Winnings Calculation**:
   - The payout for the winner can be calculated based on the total amount in the betting pool and the individual contributions.

### Formulas for Winnings and Losses

1. **Winnings Calculation for Winners**:

   - **Formula**:
     \[
     ext{Winnings} = \left(rac{ ext{Total Pool}}{ ext{Total Bets on Loser}}
     ight) imes ext{Individual Bet Amount}
     \]

2. **Losses for Supporters on Losing Side**:
   - Supporters who bet on the losing side lose their entire bet amount.

### Example Scenario

#### Example Setup

- **Total Bets**:
  - Total Bets on Challenger: \$200
  - Total Bets on Challenged: \$300
  - **Total Pool**: $500 (i.e., $200 + \$300)

#### Outcomes

- **Outcome**: Challenger wins.

#### Calculation of Winnings

- **Supporter Bets**:
  - Supporter 1 (on Challenger): Bet \$50
  - Supporter 2 (on Challenger): Bet \$150
  - Supporter 3 (on Challenged): Bet \$100
  - Supporter 4 (on Challenged): Bet \$200

#### Calculation Steps

1. **Total Bets on Challenged**: \$300
2. **Total Pool**: \$500

##### For Supporter 1:

\[
ext{Winnings} = \left(rac{500}{300}
ight) imes 50 = rac{500 imes 50}{300} pprox 83.33
\]

##### For Supporter 2:

\[
ext{Winnings} = \left(rac{500}{300}
ight) imes 150 = rac{500 imes 150}{300} pprox 250.00
\]

#### Losses Calculation for Supporters on Losing Side

- **Supporters who bet on the Challenged**:
  - Supporter 3: Bet $100 (Loss = $100)
  - Supporter 4: Bet $200 (Loss = $200)

### Summary Table of Bets

| Supporter   | Bet Amount | Outcome    | Winnings/Loss |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Supporter 1 | \$50       | Challenger | \$83.33       |
| Supporter 2 | \$150      | Challenger | \$250.00      |
| Supporter 3 | \$100      | Challenged | -\$100        |
